# Reflection to Visual Programming Lab Class

This was my first experience participating in relay coding. From this learning model, I realized that each individual has different levels of ability and distinct coding styles. This became quite challenging during the process, especially since there was no prior agreement on coding conventions (for example, whether each class should be written in a separate file or how variables should be declared).

At the beginning, the task was relatively easy because I was working with an empty workspace, which allowed me to establish my own preferred coding style. During the first switch, the codebase was still simple, with only a few variables and basic logic implemented, so I could easily understand the flow and continue developing the code while maintaining the existing style.

By the second switch, I started to feel confused with the existing code, as it was harder to grasp the overall stucture. Nevertheless, I was still able to extend and build upon what was already written. However, during the final switch, I had to work by tracing the logic in reverse, as the coded was written in a structured programming style rather than object-oriented programming (OOP).

The more people handled the same code, the harder it became to follow the logic and maintain clarity. Initially, I had conceptualized the application by dividing it into seperate classes that would be called in the 'main', keeping 'main' concise and making the program flow easier to understand. Unfortunately, not everyone shared the same approach.

If I were given the opportunity to do relay coding again, I would suggest setting clear coding conventions beforehand and applying OOP principles, as this would make it much easier for others to continue and maintain the existing code.
